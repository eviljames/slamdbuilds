digiKam is an advanced digital photo management application for linux.

The people who inspired digiKam's design are the photographers like you who
want to view, manage, edit, enhance, organize, tag, and share photographs
under Linux systems.

Most of the dependencies are already in slamd64-current, and as this is a
KDE4 release, this package is intended to be built against that (as of
17 March 2009).  The only one that was not available was JasPer, so there
is a script provided for that under Libraries/
